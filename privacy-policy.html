  <h1>Adult Content Detector - Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: [Insert Today's Date]</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the Adult Content Detector extension ("Extension") collects, uses, and discloses your information. It applies to your use of the Extension on Chrome, Brave, and Firefox web browsers.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect two main categories of information through your use of the Extension:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>**Website Content:** When you visit a webpage, the Extension analyzes the content of the page, including text, images, and hyperlinks. This analysis is performed solely on your device and the content itself is not stored by the Extension.</li>
    <li>**Limited Usage Data:** The Extension may collect limited usage data to improve its functionality. This data may include:
      <ul>
        <li>Whether adult content keywords were detected on a webpage.</li>
        <li>Whether redirection occurred due to detected adult content.</li>
        <li>The URL of the webpage where the check occurred (without personally identifiable information).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    * **Website Content Analysis:** The Extension analyzes website content solely to identify keywords indicating adult content. This allows the Extension to fulfill its core purpose of helping you avoid unwanted exposure to such content.
    <br>
    * **Limited Usage Data:** We use limited usage data in aggregate form to understand user behavior and improve the Extension's effectiveness in detecting adult content. This data is anonymized and does not contain any personally identifiable information.
  </p>

  <h2>We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>The Extension does not collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, email address, age, or identification number.</p>

  <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do not share your information with any third parties for any purpose.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <p>You can control the use of cookies by adjusting your browser settings. However, disabling cookies may limit the functionality of the Extension.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
